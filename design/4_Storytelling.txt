Title sugestion: Misconceptions about immigrants

Audience: Native inhabitants of European countries (mainly people that are scared immigrant flows will cause more terrorism)
Story: There is no positive correlation between immigrants and terrorist related attacks.
Opening: There is an increasing immigrant flow to Europe the past few years, people have the idea that this causes more terrorism. 
This idea is supported by the media that focusus on immigrants that cause terrorist attacks and politicians that are spreadding fear. 
This fear is enhanced by the attention for smaller "could be" terrorism attacks in the media. 
Climax: With statistics about migrants and terrorist attack we want to change this idea that the media sketches. The data shows that 
there actually is a negative correlation between migrants and terrorist attackts. This means that there is a decrease in terrorism 
attacks with the incomming of more migrants. We also want to show that a lot of terrorist attacks are committed by Europian organizations. 
Consequences: When more people realize immigrants are no threat, we hope people will be more open to immigrants and there will be less hatred. 
This could eventually even decrease tensions, which may result in less problems and violence. 
Take home message: Immigrants are not a threat to native inhabitants and should be distinguished from terrorist
